## Course Difficulty

- Moderate: not easiest, not hardest
    
- Requires:
    
    - Pre-calculus level math
        
    - Computational thinking
        
    - Many concepts + some memorization
        
- Astronomy 1771/1772 harder than 1070/1080 (gen eds)
    
- Astronomy 1772 will be harder than 1771

## Science and the Universe (Ch. 1.1–1.5)

### The Nature of Astronomy

- Study of objects **beyond Earth** + their interactions
    
- Also humanity’s attempt to build a **history of the universe**
    
- Science = ongoing “progress report” (new tools change understanding)

## Scientific Foundations

### 1. **Fact**

- Repeatedly confirmed observation, accepted as “true” (but always with uncertainty).
    
- Example: _“All swans are white”_ (until you see a black swan).
    

### 2. **Hypothesis**

- Tentative explanation, testable.
    
- Example: Swan is white because it’s painted / bleached / lacks pigment.
    

### 3. **Law**

- Mathematical description of how the natural world behaves.
    
- Example: Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
    
- Predictive but does **not** explain _why_.
    

### 4. **Theory**

- Well-substantiated explanation supported by facts, hypotheses, and laws.
    
- Example: Einstein’s relativity → mass curves spacetime, gravity = curvature.

### Example Breakdown

- **Fact**: “When you drop a pencil, it falls.”
    
- **Hypothesis**: “It falls because a force pulls it down.”
    
- **Law**: Newton’s gravitation formula.
    
- **Theory**: Einstein’s relativity (spacetime curvature).

## Numbers in Astronomy

- **Scientific notation example**:  
    Elon Musk’s net worth = 422.8 billion = **4.228 × 10¹¹** dollars
    
- **1 km/s for 1 million years vs. 1 parsec**:
    
    - 1 million years = 3.156 × 10⁷ s/year × 10⁶ = 3.156 × 10¹³ km
        
    - 1 parsec = 3.26 ly = 3.09 × 10¹³ km  
        → They are nearly identical!

## The Finite Speed of Light

- **Constant:** c ≈ 300,000 km/s (ultimate speed limit)
    
- **Look-Back Time:**
    
    - Sunlight = 8.3 min old
        
    - Nearest star (Proxima Centauri) = 4.2 years old
        
    - Distant galaxies = literal time travel into the past
        
- **Relativity of simultaneity:**
    
    - We can’t see the “present” state of distant objects
        
    - Whether two events are simultaneous depends on the observer

# Key Takeaways

1. **Science = facts + hypotheses + laws + theories**, each different but connected.
    
2. **Astronomy involves huge numbers** → scientific notation is essential.
    
3. **Light speed is finite**, meaning astronomy = history (we always look into the past).
    
4. **Simultaneity is relative** → no universal “now” in the universe.
