My major at the University of Iowa  is Computer Science. Iâ€™ve always been good with computers and enjoyed using technology. I played a lot of video games growing up which led to my passion with technology. After my 4 years in college I hope to get a Software Engineering job. With this job, I would be working on developing and maintaining software for a company. My hope is that I could work remotely so I can live wherever I want to. This would be an ideal outcome with my degree. Additionally, I would prefer to work on Android apps instead of Apple because as a developer, Android typically allows developers more leeway while developing apps. My biggest concern is actually landing a job out of college because the job market is oversaturated right now. Because of this, I need to focus on maintaining a good GPA and landing an internship during college.
