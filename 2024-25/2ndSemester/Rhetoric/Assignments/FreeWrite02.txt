I multi-task in some situations but not all the time. For example, tasks that don’t involve critical thinking, like putting away laundry, I multi-task by watching TV or listening to music. This is very helpful to me because it helps me get through boring and tedious tasks. However, multi-tasking isn’t always helpful to me. For example, taking notes during one of my computer science lectures is actually not beneficial to me because I just focus on writing down the material which  causes me to not comprehend the information. Because of this, I just listen to the lecture without taking notes and go back later to my professors slides to take notes.
