### Logical Fallacies

**Hasty generalization:**
Broad conclusion based on a small sample
"Everybody at the University of Iowa hates Iowa State"

**Non sequitur(it does not follow):**
evidence has no real connection to the claim
"She drives a nice car, she must be wealthy"

**Slippery Slope**
exaggeration or fear mongering 
"If we allow students to redo their assignments, soon they'll expect to redo every test, and eventually, they'll never learn to meet deadlines

**Bandwagon**:
Parker Chyma
"Everyone is buying this new phone, so it must be the best one available"

**Red Herring:**
someone distracts from the main topic of a discussion by introducing an irrelevant argument.
"We shouldn't worry about climate change because there are so many other problems in the world, like poverty and crime."
