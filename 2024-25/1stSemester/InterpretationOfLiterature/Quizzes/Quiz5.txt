Quiz5(8/10):

Choose a text we've 'read' for class this week. (2/2):
'An Ode We Owe'


Write an arguable, compelling, interpretive claim about the text you choose in the previous question. (/4):

Your Answer: 
'An Ode We Owe'


Question 2(3/4):

Write an arguable, compelling, interpretive claim about the text you choose in the previous question. 

Your Answer:

In "An Ode We Owe", the author describes the impending downfall of the world by highlighting the complacent tendencies of the wise and powerful. They understand the consequences of inaction, but still don't act. Although the negative effects of their complacency won't be immediate or directly affect them, their inaction poses monumental consequences, like irreversible effects to the climate that could lead to the end of the world. Overall, it is vital that humanity comes together and shapes a better future.Â 


Question 3(3/4)
Could a reasonable person disagree with your claim? Why or why not?

Your Answer:
A reasonable person could disagree with my claim by arguing, due to political and economic divisions, it is not even feasible to attempt to unite humanity because it would not be effective on a grand scale. Additionally, they could argue it's essential to start on a local scale because the likelihood that any progress is made is increased. Furthermore, they could argue even if politics were not a factor, people still would refuse to unite with humanity.




#feedback: 
The claim shifts away from the text a bit more than it should (and the justification for Q3 does likewise).
