Quiz10(10/10):

Question 1(3/3):

Write an arguable, compelling, interpretive claim about one of the texts we 'read' this week. 

Your Answer:
In “Wild Geese”, Mary Oliver argues that societal expectations are burdensome and unnecessary to find peace and fulfillment. Instead people can find true peace and connection through self-acceptance and recognizing one’s place in society and by realizing they don’t need to punish themselves or constantly repent for their actions.


Question 2(3/3):

Select a quote from that text relevant as evidence for your claim.

Your Answer:
"Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,  the world offers itself to your imagination,  calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting"


Question 3(4/4):
Analyze the quote. How does the quote offer evidence of your claim? Why does it support your argument? Pay careful attention to specific words and phrases from the quote itself as you make your argument. 

Your Answer:
        Within the phrase "Whoever you are, no matter how lonely”,  Oliver argues that everybody has a rightful place in the world, no matter what struggles they face or how lonely they are. The phrase “harsh and exciting” shows how the world can be a scary place, but it is also filled with opportunities and experiences that can lead to inner peace. The phrase “ the world offers itself to your imagination”, highlights how humans have the option to attempt to make the most of their lives but some people don’t take advantage of this opportunity. The phrase “calls to you” highlights how we should take advantage of this opportunity and implies that inner peace requires effort and awareness. Overall this quote supports my argument by showing how self- acceptance and the realization of one's rightful place in the world can lead to inner peace.
