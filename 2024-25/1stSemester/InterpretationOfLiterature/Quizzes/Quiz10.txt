Quiz10(9.5/10):

Question 1(3/3):

Make an arguable claim about the personal reaction you had to one of the texts we read this week. 

Your Answer:
In the 1910 film adaptation "Frankenstein", the monster was depicted as Frankenstein's inner darkness put into a monster. This made me feel unsettled because it caused me to reflect on my own inner darkness and how inner darkness can manifest in many different ways.


Question 2(3/3):

Select a quote from that text that helps illustrate why you had the reaction you did. 

Your Answer:
"Instead of a perfect human being, the evil in frankensteins mind creates a monster"
"Frankenstein appalled at the sight of his evil creation"


Question 3(3.5/4):
Use the quote as evidence for your claim. Analyze its specific language, narrative significance, thematic importance, etc. as you explore why you had the response to the text that you did. 

Your Answer:
        The phrase "the evil in Frankensteins mind creates a monster" signified that the monster was an embodiment of Frankesnsteins's inner darkness, which differs from the original book where the monster was an innocent figure who became a product of societal rejection. The word "evil" in specific, directly blames Frankenstein for the mental state of the monster. Additionally, the phrase "Frankenstein appalled at the sight of his evil creation" highlights how Frankenstein is not only horrified because of the monster's appearance, but because the monster represents his inner darkness, which is now in a physical form. Overall, the changes in the film adaptation made it a story that cautions the audience to examine their own flaws because inner darkness can manifest in unexpected ways.
