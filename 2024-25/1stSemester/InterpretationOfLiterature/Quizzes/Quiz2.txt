Quiz2(8.5/10):

Share an observation about one of the texts we read and discussed together this week. (4/5)

Your Answer:
         An observation I had in the short story “Bartleby, The Scrivener: A Story Of Wall-street” was that the lawyer could not comprehend the concept of Bartleby not conforming to societal norms. This was due to his complacent lifestyle.


What is interesting about this observation? Why did it stand out to you? (4.5/5)

Your Answer:
              The interesting thing about my observation is that the lawyer struggled to fathom the reasoning behind Baretleby’s refusal to conform to societal norms because he is fundamentally complacent. Due to this, Bartlebeys work ethic started declining once he realized the lawyer would not fire him for not doing a simple task. The lawyer's inability to understand Bartleby’s actions contrasts with his management of subpar employees, such as Turkey and Nippers. He tolerates their inconsistent and subpar work, instead of pushing them and trying to make them better workers. The lawyer's indecisiveness of how to handle Bartleby caused a rapid decline in Bartleby’s work ethic and ultimately led him to not do any work at all. This really stood out to me because, at this point, he tried to fire him. However, Bartleby knew how his boss operated and refused to leave. This led to the lawyer deciding to “furnish [him] with office-room for such period as [Bartleby] may see fit to remain”. This contrasts the lawyer's complacent lifestyle and Bartleby's refusal to conform to societal norms, which emphasizes the differences in their personalities affect their interactions with one another and the world. In conclusion, the root cause of the lawyer's inability to comprehend the concept of Bartleby not conforming to societal norms was his complacent lifestyle.
