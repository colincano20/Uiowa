Quiz1(9/10):

Share an observation about one of the texts we read and discussed together this week. (4/5)

Your Answer:
An observation I had in the essay "Is This Kansas" was that Midwestern cities, like Iowa City, spread the narrative that people are always helping, being friendly and respectful to one another.


What is interesting about this observation? Why did it stand out to you? (5/5)

Your Answer:
                The interesting thing about my observation is that big cities like New York City have a reputation for being dangerous and full of crime. However, Eula Biss, describes how Iowa City made her feel far more unsafe then New York City ever did.  This stood out to me because it challenges the usual narrative of the Midwest being a safe place. She regularly talked to the police, could not sleep because of loud parties, and was harrassed on the street. Furthermore, after a devasting hurricane in New Orleans, there were mass fake reports of looting that were reported nationwide. Ironically, after a storm in Iowa City that caused damage, there was actual looting taking place but "the looting would cease to be a story very quickly".  In conclusion, the Midwest would prefer to keep their reputation that people are always helping, being friendly and respectful to one another, rather than damage it with the countless cases of date rapes, DUI's, and looting.



#feedback: Great work on Question 2. Could be a bit more in depth for question 1, but clearly a fruitful observation for you!
