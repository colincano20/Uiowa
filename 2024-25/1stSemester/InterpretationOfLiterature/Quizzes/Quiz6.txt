Question 2(3.5/4):

Write an arguable, compelling, interpretive claim about the text you choose in the previous question. 

Your Answer:

In The Crucible Act 4, John Proctor's refusal to sign a false confession highlights the significance of standing up to corruption when it compromises your personal integrity. Personal integrity is very powerful. Which leads people to prioritize it, even when in life or death situations. Proctor's choice to die instead of living with a damaged reputation shows the importance of never abandoning your morals.


Question 3(3.5/4)
Could a reasonable person disagree with your claim? Why or why not?

Your Answer:
A reasonable person could disagree with my claim because they could argue John Proctor was being selfish, not heroic. They could argue that his refusal to sign a false confession was a selfish act of him trying to save his legacy instead of standing up to corruption.  Also, one could argue that leaving his family without support was selfish and caused more harm then good. Thus, abandoning your morals could be beneficial when it comes to family.
