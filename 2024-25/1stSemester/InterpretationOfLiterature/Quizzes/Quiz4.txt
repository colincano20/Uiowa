Quiz4(9/10):

Choose a text we've 'read' for class this week. (2/2)

Your Answer:
The Prophetess of Mars


Question 2(3/4)
Write an arguable, compelling, interpretive claim about the text you choose in the previous question. 

Your Answer:
In "The Prophetess of Mars", the people of Mars are presented with possible extinction, so they are forced to go to extreme lengths in order to prevent their extinction. Because of this, they are forced to extreme things, such as preserving the organs of dead men, in attmept to save their society. In the end, survival is not worth it if it leads people to lose their morality.


Question 3(4/4)
Could a reasonable person disagree with your claim? Why or why not?

Your Answer:
A reasonable person could disagree with my claim because people have different moral codes. They could argue that survival is the most important thing regardless of the circumstances. Additionally, in extreme situations, like possible extinction, people are more likely to do whatever is necessary to protect their families, even if they have to do immoral things. People have different sets of principles, some people believe that the ends justify the means, some people don't.



#feedback:Overall, good work here. There's lots of potential in the claim in Q2, but the wording is such that it's a bit difficult to follow the different pieces of the claim.
