Quiz15(10/10):

Question 1(5/5):

What is your favorite text we read and discussed this semester? Why?

Your Answer:
My favorite text we read this semester was 'Cat Person' because of the unsettling feeling that it gave me. The story was definitely an unique experience, one that gave me a new perspective on modern dating. Then, during our class discussions over this story, it was cool to see how unified our class was on the opinion that this story was very unsettling. Overall, through reading and discussing this story, I was surprised how most of our class shared the same interpretation of the story, which is something that was not common throughout the semester.


Question 2(5/5):

What are you looking forward to reading next (over break, next semester, over the summer, whenever)?

Your Answer:
I plan on rereading the Harry Potter series over winter break and next semester. I've been wanting to reread them for some time now but since I get a month off, I'll finally have some time to sit down and read.
