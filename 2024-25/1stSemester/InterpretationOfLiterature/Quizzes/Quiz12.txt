Quiz12(10/10):

Question 1(3/3):

Make an arguable claim about the personal reaction you had to one of the texts we read this week. 

Your Answer:
'The Man I Saw Them Kill",Â  caused me to feel disturbed because it made me a supporter of the death penalty even though It's hard to support the death penalty when so much death and violence are present.


Question 2(3/3):

Select a quote from that text that helps illustrate why you had the reaction you did. 

Your Answer:
"But arguments for the death penalty are visceral: the blood of a baby girl seeping out into her eyes, the tangled scars crisscrossing her soft skin."(3)


Question 3(4/4):
Use the quote as evidence for your claim. Analyze its specific language, narrative significance, thematic importance, etc. as you explore why you had the response to the text that you did. 

Your Answer:
        The whole quote, "But arguments for the death penalty are visceral: the blood of a baby girl seeping out into her eyes, the tangled scars crisscrossing her soft skin." uses vivid language to show the horror of Bourgeois's crime. Furthermore, the words "blood," "seeping," and "tangled scars" enraged me because I now knew the horrific reality of his crimes. This is especially haunting because it was a defenseless and innocent child who was hurt. In addition, the use of the word "visceral" shows the disgust and anger that a crime like this provokes, which could even the most loyal anti-death penalty supporter question their position on it. By focusing on these details, it forces the reader to wonder if crimes like these need the death penalty for retribution. Overall, this imagery left me feeling disturbed because it made me question my own stance on the death penalty.
