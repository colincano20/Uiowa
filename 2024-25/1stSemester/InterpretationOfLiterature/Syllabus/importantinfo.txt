. Therefore, I allow each student four
absences without penalty
Each unexcused absence beyond the permitted four will lower your final grade in the
course by 1/3 of a letter grade. So, with five unexcused absences, an A becomes an A- and a
B- becomes a C+. With six unexcused absences, an A becomes a B+, a B- becomes a C, etc.
