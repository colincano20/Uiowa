# The Interpretation of Literature

**Professor: Conor Hilton**

## Course Description (MyUI):
This course will explore the intersections of literature and community across time, space, genre, and a variety of demographics. Our discussions will be animated by questions such as, “What do we owe each other?”, “how do we build and create community?”, and “how do we balance individuality and interdependence?”.

We’ll explore the obligations of a creator to their creation in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein! We’ll discuss the beauty and suffering of rural America embodied in The Killers’ Pressure Machine! We’ll dig into the horror and current applicability of the Salem Witch Trials as depicted in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible!

These conversations will be enriched by our engagement with speculative short stories, contemporary poetry, blockbuster films, the history of utopian communities, and so much more.
