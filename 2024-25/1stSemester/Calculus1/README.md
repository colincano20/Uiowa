# Calculus I

**Professor: Hao Fang**

## Course Description (MyUI):
Topics include fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques of integral and differential calculus of a single variable. The sequence MATH:1850 and MATH:1860 is one of the basic entry-level mathematics courses for students in the mathematical and physical sciences. The course is designed to be a half-year course; it is not, in general, recommended that students plan to take MATH:1850 and not MATH:1860. Engineering students and others who plan to take MATH:1560, MATH:2550, and MATH:2560 should take MATH:1550. The course is taught in either of two formats. In one format, students meet in sections of 60, three times per week with a faculty member, and two times a week for discussions with a TA in sections of 20 students. The second format has four meetings per week in a class of about 30, with one instructor (faculty or experienced TA). With either format, Math Lab tutoring is offered for additional help.
