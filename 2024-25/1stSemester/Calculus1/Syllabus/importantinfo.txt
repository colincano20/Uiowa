Grading System:
With criterion-reference grading, students receive grades based on the quality of their work in relation to the criteria defined by the instructor and by the rubrics or models specifying the qualities of each grade.  The cut scores (e.g. 90 for A-) will never go up, but they may go down for some exams, and each exam will be treated separately.  We will start with the following ranges:

 

A                     B                     C                     D                     F       

A+ [97,100]   B+ [80,90)     C+ [65,70)     D+ [45,50)     F [0,40)

A   [90,97)     B   [75,80)     C   [55,65)     D   [40,45)

A-  [85,90)     B-  [70,75)     C-  [50,55)     D-  [35,40)

 

Suggested study techniques for the exam are for the student to complete all the assigned readings for the exam and then to use course notes to be sure that they are familiar with all the terms and concepts outlined on the study guide. The exams may have open-solution problems and multiple-choice problems. Information on each exam structure will be provided when the study guide for the exam is posted on ICON.  All exams are comprehensive, unless specified otherwise.
