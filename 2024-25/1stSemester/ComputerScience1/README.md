Computer-Science-1
Professor: Alberto Segre
Course Description (MyUI):
This is the introduction-to-programming course in the computer science major and minor curricula. Prior programming experience is not required, although some students will have had some previous exposure to programming. It emphasizes object-oriented programming style and methodology. The lecture is taught three times a week. The 75-minute discussion periods, led by a TA, are used to discuss programming exercises, hold quizzes, and to answer questions in a small classroom atmosphere. Concepts are presented in the context of working examples and exercises. Language syntax and computing paradigms are studied. Programming projects are used to reinforce key programming notions, including iteration, data types, functions, and objects. Projects may include graphics, string processing, and network applications. Lectures are taught by a faculty member; discussion sections are led by TAs.

Assignment Notes:
Some of the question of the days (QotD) and lab assignments are not correct solutions.

The labs were a weekly assignment that we were pair into groups of 2 or 3 that usually build off each other.
