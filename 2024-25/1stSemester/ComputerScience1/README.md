# Computer Science I: Fundamentals

**Professor: Alberto Segre**

## Course Description (MyUI):
This course introduces students to computational problem solving and algorithmic thinking by providing them with intensive programming experience. This is the introduction to computer science course for CS majors and minors, Data Science majors, CS&E majors, and students from other disciplines (e.g., mathematics, statistics) where a solid foundation in computer science as well as fluency in computer programming is required. Prior programming experience is not required, although some students will have had some previous exposure to programming. The course consists of a lecture, taught three times a week and a 75-minute lab-based discussion period, led by a TA. The labs are used for programming practice under the guidance of a TA in a small classroom atmosphere.  Topics include algorithm correctness and run-time analysis, data representation and manipulation, control strategies, functions, recursion, objects and classes and the course will use Python (more specifically, Python 3) as the programming language. Course evaluation will be based on regular in-class quizzes, weekly programming exercises, weekly labs, 2-3 programming projects, 2 midterms and 1 final. Lectures are taught by a faculty member; discussion sections are led by TAs.

## Assignment Notes:
Some of the question of the days (QotD) and lab assignments are not correct solutions.
The labs were a weekly assignment that we were pair into groups of 2 or 3 that usually build off each other.
