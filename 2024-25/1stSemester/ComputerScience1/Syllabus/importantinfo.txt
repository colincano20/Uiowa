Grading Breakdown:
Question of the Day (QotD: 5%): your final QotD grade is reported as the percentage of correct QOTDs after dropping the lowest 25% of your QotD scores
Lab assignments(Labs: 14%): your final laboratory grade is computed after dropping your three lowest laboratory assignment scores 
Homework assignments (HWs: 15%): There will be 2 (or possibly 3 smaller) multi-week homework assignments consisting of larger programming projects 
         important: homework assignments will be due Friday at midnight. Late assignments will be accepted until Sunday at midnight, late 75%   cap
Midterm exams (Ex: 18% each):
Final exam (Final: 30%): 

This course uses letter grades. Because CLAS discourages the use of norms-referenced grading (the
"curve"), we will adopt a standard (A:90-100, B:80-89.99, C:70-79.99, D:60-69.99, F:0-59.99) grading
scale. Plus/minus grades will be awarded sparingly at the instructorâ€™s discretion to recognize those with
exceptional performance or who are unnervingly close to the cusp. Note that, because it is sometimes
hard to predict class performance on challenging material, the standard CLAS scale may result in
unreasonably low letter grades. We will therefore have three "true-ups" over the course of the term: once
after each midterm, and a final "true-up" at end of term. A "true-up" is an opportunity for me to lower
(never raise) the cutoffs based on the grade distribution so far: thus each "true-up" can only improve your
letter grade, never make it worse.
